Moved to Codeberg:

Why NOT GitHub?
- Don't want to do "personal contributions" when updating dotfiles, blog, or something else.
- Don't want to do "commit farming", which is creating an appearance of high activity.
- Don't want to misrepresent my activity level because I prefer to do genuine contributions.

And why GitHub?

- For meaningful projects
- For collaboration
- For social media
